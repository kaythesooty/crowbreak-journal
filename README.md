# Journal of Crowbreak
Crowbreak is a warrior of WhisperClan. This is a website dedicated to their journey. I'm using [Lifegen](https://github.com/sedgestripe/clangen/tree/LifeGen-dev) to create their story.

## Where's the site?
Nowhere yet, but feel free to clone this repo and run it with vite. Or deploy it yourself somewhere idc.

## Credits

* [Lifegen](https://github.com/sedgestripe/clangen/tree/LifeGen-dev), a great mod for Clangen.
